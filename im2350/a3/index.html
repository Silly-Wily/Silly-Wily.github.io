      <h3>Where the background video came from</h3>

      <p>The video is from one of my other projects that I produced this semester. I used a small segment of it that I enjoyed the most and extended it into a 9 second clip.
        I created the effect by filling up a fish tank I purchased from Kmart and then proceeded to drop food coloured milk into the water with a teaspoon or chopsticks, trying to
        create small droplets. I inverted the colours and produced a glitched type effect to make the video more immersive and visually appealing. I enjoyed the process of creating it
        and I hope that you find the background video enjoyable as well.

      <h3>The scrolling effect</h3>

      <p> When thinking of an idea, I thought it would be interesting to have an animated background that is always present as you scroll down a webpage. I saw that Apple products have 
        their own webpage that has some sections of animated images, which I thought was exactly what I wanted to try and recreate. There were many ways in creating the animated background,
        one being having multiple images of each frame, whereas you scroll a new image will appear, or have it so that a video is scrubbing through as you are scrolling down the webpage.
        The latter is what I decided on, as I felt that it would be easier to accomplish and with the assistance of my teacher it was achievable.

      <h3>Text fade in effect</h3>

      <p>The text fade in effect was just another element I wanted to add to be a part of the scroll function. I wanted to have an animation so that the webpage doesn't look as stiff and so that
        the background isn't the only thing that is moving. I therefore looked on how to create a simple fade in transition and further added a blur effect, so that the animation feels more seamless.
        I wanted to keep it simple, and I am satisfied with how it turned out.

      <h3>Difficulties</h3>

      <p>There were quite a few difficulties when putting together this webpage that I thought I might as well talk about. I found it difficult initially to figure out how I wanted the video to play as you scroll up and down the webpage.
        I started off with thinking I could use the Y position of the webpage to play and rewind, but I found that it wasn't working as I wanted it to. I was then told that I can just have the webpage detect the scroll wheel itself,
        so that even if you reach the top or bottom of the webpage, if the video hasn't ended or isn't at the beginning, you can continue playing the video by scrolling. </p>

        <p>There were some other elements that I expressed in my presentation that I found were unnecessary now. One of them being to have the text in more random positions on the x axis, I found that when the text was all centred, 
        it looked a lot nicer than the thought of having them all over the place. I also had the idea of coding in a scroll speed limiterso that there won't be any issues if the user tries to scroll really fast down the webpage. 
        But what I found was that even if you scroll really fast down the webpage the code can keep up to it and doesn't break, therefore I found the needfor the scroll speed limiter was unnecessary. Another element I wanted to add was to have
        additional information appear when you hover on text. I felt that this doesn't keep with the scroll function that I am wanting to highlight and decided against implementing it into the webpage.
