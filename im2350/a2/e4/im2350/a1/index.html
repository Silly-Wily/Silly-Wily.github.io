    <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>

    <p>
      
      It's hard to think  of the first thing that caught my attention due to how chaotic the initial page is.
      I ended up clicking all of the moving objects first to see if I could remove them off my screen.
      This sometimes resulted in the 'x' on each tab to disappear and the tab still being present with out being able to close it
    
    </p>

    <h3>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>

    <ol>

      <li>Clicked every single tab that emerged to see what would happen</li> 
      <li>Clicked on the tab stating to accept cookies. I collected all the cookies that were suddenly bouncing around.</li>
      <li>I clicked on the monkey which resulted into it turning into bones. I then put all his bones into the rubbish bin.</li>
      <li>I key ended up appearing on my screen in whcih I then unlocked access to the neighbourhood.</li>
      <li>I didn't go to the neighbourhood straight away, I clicked on the start button in the bottom left and spawned more skeleton bones onto my screen.</li>
      <li>Once all the bones were in the flaming bin, I entered the neighbourhood.</li>
      <li>I ended up finding a stray cat in a buildig prompting me to donate money.</li>
      <li>I closed the webpage.</li>
      
    </ol>

    <h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>

    <p>

      I spent most of my time trying to close all of the tabs that were covering the initial screen. It felt annoying having all the tabs constantly bouncing around the screen, causing me to be constantly engaged in the moving tabs.
      
    </p>

    <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>

    <p>

      I spent most of the time being forced to open tabs or close them, hindering me from the main experience. Unless that was a part of the experience in itself.

    </p>

    <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>

    <p>

      My impression of the intended primary goal was to have a provided chaotic narrative that you are able to go through at your own pace, whether it's opening random tabs or closing them, 
      eventually you will reach the intended ending. All that is wanted is to explore the webpage and try to uncover its  secrets.

    </p>

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>

    <p>

      It provides the interactive experience in a chatoic manner, by forcing the user to open/close tabs, otherwise they'll constantly be present on your screen.
      There was also minigames that you could play, such as putting bones into a bin or finding the weird disturbance in a neighbourhood.
      Each interaction gradually took you to the same place.  

    </p>

    <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>

    <p>

      My impression is that the time spent interacting with the webpage is purely dependent on the user themseleves, whether they want to spend a short time looking at it, going through the main areas.
      Or users could spend as much time as they desire, looking at every single spot on the webpage to try and find any secrets or other minigames that they could enjoy. 

    </p>

    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>

    <p>

      I believe the interactive experience tries to invoke the user in taking there time, and to also feel a sense of interruption and frustration.
      By having a multitude of notifications and text floating around the screen, almost encouraging the user to interact with them.

    </p>

    <h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>

    <p>

    Some aspects of the website refer back to the original design of windows, and its overall aesthetic. Other forms of media that were present were pop up ads, memes, as it forced the user to open each ad tab, otherwise it would not go away.

    </p>

    <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

    <p>

    Ultimately, the website enforced this particular engagement, otherwise the pop ups would be constantly moving on your screen, sometimes blocking you from interacting with other tabs.
    It encourages the user to click on all the tabs and experience what each one does before transitioning onto the next area of the website

    </p>

    <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>

    <p>

    I believe you should feel a sense of curiosity whilst exploring the website as well as a sense of annoyance. The annoyance comes from the constant pop up tabs that are a hassle to close.


    </p>

    <h3>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>

    <p>

      The most frustrating part would be the constant pop up ads and being unable to close them unless they are opened. I understand that it's part of the experience but it was just extremely irritating to deal with.
      Furthermore, certain segments resulted in a 'donation wall' where I wasn't able to progress or obtain anything unless I dontaed money.

    </p>

    <h3>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>

    <p>

      There were some very minor activities that I enjoyed whilst exploring the website, one of those was the skeletons falling from the sky and me having to put them in the recycling bin. 
      After that I opened up the start tab and spawned more bones in. For some reason I enjoyed doing this task, most probably due to its simplicity and the small sound effects that are made when they are placed in.
